## Abuse Prevention Strategies
The system includes several layers of protection to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage:

### 1. **Cooldown Timer (Backend-Controlled) ‚è≥**
- A **2-minute cooldown** period is implemented to prevent users from rapidly claiming multiple coupons.
- Each user's IP address and session ID are tracked. Any attempts to claim a coupon within the cooldown period are blocked.
- Users are informed about the remaining cooldown time if they attempt to claim a coupon too soon.

### 2. **Session ID for Enhanced Security**
- Each user is assigned a **unique session ID** stored in an **HTTP-only cookie** for added security.
- Even if a user deletes their `localStorage` data, the cooldown timer persists because of backend-based session tracking.

### 3. **Hybrid Countdown Timer (Best UX Solution) üïí**
To balance performance and persistence:
- The **frontend** displays a real-time countdown timer using `localStorage`.
- The **backend** periodically validates the timer every minute or when the page is refreshed to ensure accuracy.

## API Endpoints
### **Claim Coupon**
`POST /api/coupons/claim`
- Claims the next available coupon if no active cooldown is present.

### **Add Coupon**
`POST /api/coupons/add`
- Adds a new coupon to the database.(I had used Postman for adding data to the MongoDB Database)
